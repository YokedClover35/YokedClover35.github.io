X-initialize all points and assign random velocities
X-create a hashmap using a single integer storing both x,y as the key and the item being the point
X-handle proximity detection using a small -hash- array grid for particle to particle collision
X-handle proximity detection to mouse using a simple 0(N) algorithm
X-create lines between close enough points (must be smaller than the grid?)
-make expanding grid selection radius
-create triangles using the lines and decide color based on the center of the triangle
-allow for users to create simulation setting configs and maybe store them as cookies?
-side bar settings menu
