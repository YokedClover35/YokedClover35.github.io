X-initialize all points and assign random velocities
X-create a hashmap using a single integer storing both x,y as the key and the item being the point
-handle proximity detection using a small hash grid for particle to particle collision
-handle proximity detection to mouse using a simple 0(N) algorithm
-create lines between close enough points (must be smaller than the grid?)
-create triangles using the lines and decide color based on the center of the triangle
-...

--Remember--
-make resizing work
